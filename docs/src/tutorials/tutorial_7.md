# Tutorial 7: Couple Two Existing Models

We have written up a repository and accompanying notebook [here](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiFUND-MimiFAIR-Flat.jl/blob/main/MimiFUND-MimiFAIR-Flat.ipynb) to demonstrate the steps to couple together two existing models, both configured as packages, specifically in this case replacing (most of) the [FUND model](https://github.com/fund-model/MimiFUND.jl)'s climate module with the [FAIR model](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiFAIR.jl).
